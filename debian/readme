The files in this directory are used to build a Debian package and are
derived from the Debian rules developed by Joel Rosdahl.

Differences:

 - We remain compatible with older releases packaging tools (eg
   debhelper, various control fields)

 - SQLite is included statically into the extension (ignoring
   system SQLite)

 - All extensions are enabled in SQLite (RTree, FTS3, ICU) and
   the asyncvfs is added

 - The documentation includes a separate copy of the JQuery 
   Javascript library.  (The official Debian/Ubuntu packages
   omit that and link to a central shared copy of jquery.js)
